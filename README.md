# What is a NOC?
A Network Operations Center (NOC) serves as a centralized hub where IT administrators (whether internal or third-party) oversee, monitor, and maintain a telecommunications network. Typically found in large enterprises and commercial network service providers, a NOC is equipped with devices that offer visualizations of the monitored networks. It comprises workstations displaying detailed network statuses and employs network management software.

Essentially acting as the nervous system for these organizations, the NOC plays a vital role in managing and optimizing critical business tasks. This includes activities such as network troubleshooting, software distribution and updates, router and domain name management, performance monitoring, and coordination with affiliated networks. It's the command center for ensuring the seamless operation and efficiency of the enterprise's network infrastructure.

The NOC's most important role is to provide full visibility into the enterprise infrastructure and all components and equipment the network is comprised of,  including the following:

  - network devices
  - servers
  - firewalls
  - databases
  - virtual machines (VMs)
  - software and services (internal and external)
  - wireless systems
  - internet of things devices

# NOC Engineer

A NOC Engineer is responsible for overseeing and executing the day-to-day operational activities required to manage IT services and the associated IT infrastructure. Key tasks for a NOC engineer involve analyzing events, troubleshooting, responding to incidents on the systems, and communicating with on-site technicians or third parties involved in resolution. They diligently track issues from identification to resolution.

Field Engineer outlines four essential roles for NOC Engineers:

  1. **Monitor Systems:** Utilizing a variety of tools to observe the performance and capability of computer systems.
  2. **Troubleshoot Problems:** Engaging in triage and troubleshooting activities to address issues within their designated areas of responsibility.
  3. **Track Issues:** Thoroughly documenting all defects and resolutions in a designated ticketing system to maintain a detailed record.
  4. **Report Incidents:** Escalating complex issues to management, other IT resources, third parties, or vendors as needed, ensuring effective resolution and coordination.

In essence, NOC Engineers play a critical role in maintaining the functionality and efficiency of IT services and infrastructure, addressing issues promptly, and ensuring proper communication throughout the resolution process.

ITSM Activities of a NOC Engineer

Based on these activities, some basic ITIL 4 practices can be applied to what the NOC Engineer’s role involves. These include:
**_Monitoring_** and **_Event Management_**

The NOC engineer will be involved in both proactive and reactive monitoring of technology systems within their scope:

    Servers
    Network infrastructure
    Apps
    Databases
    Even data centers

Monitoring involves repeated observation to detect events and to ensure that the current status is known. The event management part focuses on determining significance of events in order to trigger the appropriate response.

**Incident Management**

The NOC engineer will be involved in first line troubleshooting of incidents arising from monitoring. During this activity, the NOC engineer will:

    Record incidents and correlate them with the events
    Apply appropriate workarounds
    Communicate and coordinate resolution with other support levels including third party partners and vendors.

**Problem Management**

To support proactive problem management, the NOC engineer will correlate incidents with existing problems and also participate in identification of new problems. As workarounds and known errors are a huge part of the NOC engineer’s work, they will work together with a problem analyst to identify and document these.

**Deployment Management**

To manage deployments, the NOC engineer will support planning and execution of changes in production environments especially deployment of new and changed features as well as patch management.

NOC engineers are an invaluable resource when it comes to identifying both positive and negative impact of changes post-deployment.

**Availability, Capacity, and Performance Management**

The NOC engineer supports these practices by:

    Proactive and Reactive monitoring
    Providing information on components and services availability, capacity, and performance metrics

**Service Continuity Management**

The NOC engineer participates in:

    Routine activities (like back up and restoration of systems)
    Disaster recovery activities (like executing system failover scripts)

**Infrastructure and Platform Management**

The NOC engineer can be involved in installation and configuration of infrastructure and platforms (whether on-premise or cloud-hosted), where these activities have been defined as routine procedures.

**Information Security Management**

The NOC engineer can also be equipped with knowledge on identification and first line support for information security events and incidents.
